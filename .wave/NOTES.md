PERSONAL NOTES TO ADD TO GITIGNORE / DO NOT REMOVE!

Need drag and drop from files to viewer
Need option to open file in default viewer (need a default viewer)
Need a treeview, not a file explorer like we have now, slimmer, easier to navigate, synced with the main folder of the tab
Need a Project Notes widget
Need a TODO Widget, sync to file, allow images (paste image, save in folder, similar to md view)

need positiblity to add images to notes

bugs: can't type in the preview (note editor), I type 1 char and the focus goes out of there, after a brief "loading" that pops up.. 

Bug: smart directory change only stores in base dir if enabled by prompting.

Feat: need to hover OVER PATH, AND SHOW ME an entire menu  treeview

Bug: Notas does not respect the end of the page

back and forward with mouse buttons on web view
Bug/feat: todo and notas do not answer to mouse buttons 4 and 5 (back forth) like the other components like web or terminal do regardless if they do anything or not, at least they do focus on mouse click.

bug: resuming an instance after restart, does not start the terminal in the correct folders
Bug: notas does not scroll properly, or not at all. 


Bug: notas does not wrap text correctly, it actually has a few characters, probably the left line number column that do not wrap correctly
